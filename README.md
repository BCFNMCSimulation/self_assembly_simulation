# Hard-Sphere-Monte-Carlo

## Introduction

Written for first year BCFN students at the University of Bristol as part of the computational nanoscience course by Paddy Royall.

The code here is an aid for students to understand basic Monte-Carlo simulation. It is written in a way that student without prior programming experiences could easily understand it. We deliberately avoided any advanced python features and libraries. Students with prior experience of python may find more pythonic code and tricks in the [repository from Josh](https://github.com/tranqui/monte_carlo), which performs the same Monte-Carlo simulation.

## What to Do

There are four steps towards a successful Monte-Carlo simulation  of hard spheres.

1. Simulating a random gas with the periodic boundary condition (PBC).
2. Simulating repelling hard spheres with PBC.
3. Simulating attracting hard spheres with PBC.
4. Change the parameters and observe different behaviours.
